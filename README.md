A discord bot, that plays a sound everytime someone joins a chat that the bot already is
Also the command >play, makes the bot plays a  random "Rodrigo Faro" Sound effect

To make it work, you have to use your own discord token, and the path where the EXE of FFMpeg is in your computer
Then add the bot to your server runs the code and have fun
